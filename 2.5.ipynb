       "      <td>This is a fine piece of cinema from Wong Kar-Wai that tells us a story of two people whom circumstance throws together - but not in a way you might expect. We start with two couples who move into a new building. One a newspaper man with his wife, the other a business executive and his wife. The businessman is rarely at home, nor is the journalist's wife - which leaves the other two at increasingly loose ends. It isn't long before a friendship develops - usually over some noodles - and though entirely platonic, their relationship becomes solid and trusting. Then, something entirely unexpected occurs that causes the two to refocus their relationship in the face of betrayal and disappointment - and well.... What helps this film stand out are the performances from both Tony Leung (\"Chow Mo-wan\") and the gorgeous Maggie Cheung (\"Mrs. Chan\") - it's a love story, and it burns intensely - but not physically - as their story subsumes both themselves and the audience. The film looks marvellous, is paced stylishly and uses quite a bit of Nat King Cole to set and keep the mood atmospheric, romantic and interesting. The photography offers us lingering close ups, we get a sense of them falling in love as if we, too, were undergoing the same experience and that all adds to the richness of the story. To give us a breather from the intensity, there are some fun scenes with their very close neighbours who love nothing better than to sit up all night playing mahjong!!

It's seemingly based on a whole range of classic movies from the \"Great Escape\", \"Star Trek\" to \"Love Story\" with a score cannibalised from just about any/everything ever written by Messrs. Korngold/Williams &amp; Bernstein all adding to this really super stop-motion animation that Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of.. A flock of chickens are relentlessly exploited for their eggs by the evil \"Mrs Tweedy\" - that is, until \"Rocky\" (an on-form Mel Gibson) arrives over the fence and incites escape plans... Meantime their malevolent owner (Miranda Richardson) has plans to industrialise production - and this time, not just of the eggs... It's a fun frolic, this - with great vocal performances from Jane Horrocks, Julia Sawalha and Benjamin Whitrow as the rather pompous RAF spotter chicken \"Fowler\". Nick Park and Peter Lord - and the wonderfully imaginative Aardman team - have built upon their \"Wallace and Gromit\" experience and created some charming characters with some great lines for both the young, and the formerly young. Certainly a film you can leave the kids alone in front of the telly to.</td>\n",

Despite a pretty simple feel to the film, it's a very well developed concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe, admittedly short, run time truly flies by. Of course everything looks, relatively, terrific, but I'm impressed by the pacing which is clean. As for the cast, Julia Sawalha is the definite standout - she's fantastic as Ginger. Timothy Spall and Phil Daniels, as rats Nick and Fetcher, are amusing. Mel Gibson (Rocky), though still decent, isn't actually that good in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fun and interesting story! Definitely worth seeing if you haven't already. I'm intrigued to see where they go with the upcoming sequel.   \n",

It's seemingly based on a whole range of classic movies from the \"Great Escape\", \"Star Trek\" to \"Love Story\" with a score cannibalised from just about any/everything ever written by Messrs. Korngold/Williams & Bernstein all adding to this really super stop-motion animation that Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of.. A flock of chickens are relentlessly exploited for their eggs by the evil \"Mrs Tweedy\" - that is, until \"Rocky\" (an on-form Mel Gibson) arrives over the fence and incites escape plans... Meantime their malevolent owner (Miranda Richardson) has plans to industrialise production - and this time, not just of the eggs... It's a fun frolic, this - with great vocal performances from Jane Horrocks, Julia Sawalha and Benjamin Whitrow as the rather pompous RAF spotter chicken \"Fowler\". Nick Park and Peter Lord - and the wonderfully imaginative Aardman team - have built upon their \"Wallace and Gromit\" experience and created some charming characters with some great lines for both the young, and the formerly young. Certainly a film you can leave the kids alone in front of the telly to.   \n",

Like many movies, the plot relies on a huge coincidence or three. The story gets sappy and sentimental in places, is rather predictable and has too much religion to suit me, but that last thing may suit you just fine, praise be. It was co-written and directed by the actress Bonnie Hunt, who is a supporting character in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is a spark of chemistry between the two lead characters, the dialogue is smart and sharp, and the movie is rich with its supporting cast, such as Jim Belushi, Robert Loggia and Archie Bunker - I mean Carroll O’Connor.

       "      <td>All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.\\r\\n\\r\\nPitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... \\r\\n\\r\\nOkies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade \"A\" from those involved. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10</td>\n",

Like many movies, the plot relies on a huge coincidence or three. The story gets sappy and sentimental in places, is rather predictable and has too much religion to suit me, but that last thing may suit you just fine, praise be. It was co-written and directed by the actress Bonnie Hunt, who is a supporting character in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is a spark of chemistry between the two lead characters, the dialogue is smart and sharp, and the movie is rich with its supporting cast, such as Jim Belushi, Robert Loggia and Archie Bunker - I mean Carroll O’Connor. Plus I have liked Minnie Driver since Circle of Friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust keep in mind this isn’t Hitchcock or Frank Capra stuff and doesn’t try to be. Just let it flow over you   \n",
       "21  All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.\\r\\n\\r\\nPitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... \\r\\n\\r\\nOkies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade \"A\" from those involved. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10   \n",

This film creates so much lore for the past movies seemingly out of the blue, muddling up the continuity for shock value. It added very little to this film and felt forced. The entire plot point of Sidney’s mother being a former Hollywood actress was pretty lame, especially with the added plot point of her being sexually assaulted by a movie producer. It may be personal taste, but I absolutely despise when films add that plot point, as it feels incredibly hypocritical since it is something that genuinely happens to an industry, they are involved in. The love triangle between Gale, Dewey, and the Gale actress was pretty dumb and felt undeserved, as we have not seen Gale and Dewey actually together in any of the films.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn horror films, you can have a good movie with a terrible plot as long as the kills are great. Unfortunately, Scream 3 continues the trend of having boring kills with no imagination. There has been only one truly unique kill throughout the entire franchise, and the rest are unbloody stab kills. I understand the meta being about stabbing with a knife, as the in-film movie is called Stab, but please add some gore to it. There is nothing, no blood squirts or body horror, and it caused the entire movie to be boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur performances were exactly how I would describe Scream 2, with both Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox being the standouts and David Arquette being average at best. All of the new characters were pretty uninteresting, all of the actors in the film were annoying, and the movie producers felt generic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direction of this film felt pretty uninspired. I am not sure if Wes Craven was forced to make this movie by the studio, but nothing about it felt unique and creative. It felt like he was phoning it in for a paycheck.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, there were not a lot of redeeming qualities for this film, and it left me feeling unfulfilled as the final credits rolled.

However, a TV series had been made that had little or nothing to do with the original film. What this movie came to try to do is to bring together the best of both worlds, but it failed completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problems start at the bottom, that is, in the miserably written script and without ideas that can truly be considered good or intelligent. At no time did I feel that the story of this film was interesting or captivating enough to justify the effort of seeing it. From the development it makes, we must assume that the action takes place after what we saw in the original film, which doesn't make much sense if we remember that this film ends in the victory of Connor, the last and only Immortal. The film has lots of plot holes and moments where logic and coherence take a vacation and disappear. The dialogues are poor, poorly finished and annoying. Historical flashbacks don't always work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast counts, for the last time, with the honorable participation of Christopher Lambert, now a mature actor. So mature it sounds dangerously old for the role he plays. Despite this, the actor does what he can with what little he has. Adrian Paul also doesn't let us down and gives a good performance, considering the filthy and regrettable quality of the material written for this film. Bruce Payne sounds histrionic and unconvincing, but he does what he has to do. The rest of the actors don't really have anything really good worth mentioning in detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictim of a very low budget, the film appears for what it is: a very cheap and undercooked production, which tastes bad and looks even worse than it tastes. An excuse for an action movie with swords and frantic duels amid a series of abandoned or deserted industrial sites. The cinematography, sets and costumes are what we would expect to find, but the visual effects and CGI are poor, amateurish and really inexcusable in a 2000s full-length film.

Jackson) where he tries to apprehend an arrogant racist killer (Christian Bale) by finding a key witness (Toni Collette) while dealing with a gang lord (Jeffrey Wright) and corrupt cops. Vanessa Williams is on hand as a helpful officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shaft” (2000) is a ‘hip’ crime thriller that resurrects the franchise 27 years after the original trilogy from 1971-1973 that featured Richard Roundtree in the title role (he returns here as the aged uncle). The cast and filmmaking are fine; the problem is the lame story with which they’re shackled. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key crime in the opening act is glaringly weak. Bale’s character is a snooty punk born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but I didn’t buy his rash, racist actions at the night club. It just didn’t ring true, especially since he seems to get along with black people just fine the rest of the movie. Likewise, Collette’s actions aren’t convincing as the doe-eyed bartender. Simply put, the scriptwriters tried too hard to concoct a racist whitey villain when subtly was in order.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can roll with that serious flaw, there are enough thrills to amuse, including Jackson as the bad axx protagonist and Wright’s entertaining drug lord. Plus it’s always good to see the charming Vanessa Williams. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in various areas of New York City, as well as nearby Newark. \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: C-</td>\n",

Again, of course seeing Hunt climb a mountain without a harness is impressive sure. And I even quite liked the idea behind the villain of the piece (though even that angle was woefully underdeveloped).\\r\\n\\r\\nEven setting it in predominantly Australia was enough to grab my attention, and that's saying something cause I'm pretty biased when it comes to that. I hear tell that _Mission: Impossible II_ is the low point in the series, and that at least is encouraging, because if anything afterwards is much worse than this one, I don't know if I'll be able to make it through to Rogue Nation.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Final rating:★½: - Boring/disappointing.

As if the screenwriters didn't know how to fill the 2 hrs with action the overuse of heroic slow motion scenes is horrible. You almost might need a barf bag if you can't stand slo-mo every five seconds... for 15 seconds. I am amazed they did decide to push on with more M:I movies after this one, then again, these turned out much much better even if it would be hard to beat that lousy piece of crap of a movie.   \n",
       "20  **_Scream 3’s_ lackluster screenplay and unimaginative kills leave a film that is a bore to watch.**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meta-narrative of trilogies throughout the film does not make up for how abysmal the plot was. This film creates so much lore for the past movies seemingly out of the blue, muddling up the continuity for shock value. It added very little to this film and felt forced. The entire plot point of Sidney’s mother being a former Hollywood actress was pretty lame, especially with the added plot point of her being sexually assaulted by a movie producer. It may be personal taste, but I absolutely despise when films add that plot point, as it feels incredibly hypocritical since it is something that genuinely happens to an industry, they are involved in. The love triangle between Gale, Dewey, and the Gale actress was pretty dumb and felt undeserved, as we have not seen Gale and Dewey actually together in any of the films.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn horror films, you can have a good movie with a terrible plot as long as the kills are great. Unfortunately, Scream 3 continues the trend of having boring kills with no imagination. There has been only one truly unique kill throughout the entire franchise, and the rest are unbloody stab kills. I understand the meta being about stabbing with a knife, as the in-film movie is called Stab, but please add some gore to it. There is nothing, no blood squirts or body horror, and it caused the entire movie to be boring.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur performances were exactly how I would describe Scream 2, with both Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox being the standouts and David Arquette being average at best. All of the new characters were pretty uninteresting, all of the actors in the film were annoying, and the movie producers felt generic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direction of this film felt pretty uninspired. I am not sure if Wes Craven was forced to make this movie by the studio, but nothing about it felt unique and creative. It felt like he was phoning it in for a paycheck.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, there were not a lot of redeeming qualities for this film, and it left me feeling unfulfilled as the final credits rolled. Hoping Scream IV has more in store for me than this lackluster film.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Score:** _45%_\\r\\n**Verdict:** _Poor_   \n",
       "31                                                                                                       **There should have been only one!**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf “Highlander 2” was a complete disgrace and “Highlander 3” somehow tried to give us some compensation, this movie makes it look worse and more worn out. However, a TV series had been made that had little or nothing to do with the original film. What this movie came to try to do is to bring together the best of both worlds, but it failed completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problems start at the bottom, that is, in the miserably written script and without ideas that can truly be considered good or intelligent. At no time did I feel that the story of this film was interesting or captivating enough to justify the effort of seeing it. From the development it makes, we must assume that the action takes place after what we saw in the original film, which doesn't make much sense if we remember that this film ends in the victory of Connor, the last and only Immortal. The film has lots of plot holes and moments where logic and coherence take a vacation and disappear. The dialogues are poor, poorly finished and annoying. Historical flashbacks don't always work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cast counts, for the last time, with the honorable participation of Christopher Lambert, now a mature actor. So mature it sounds dangerously old for the role he plays. Despite this, the actor does what he can with what little he has. Adrian Paul also doesn't let us down and gives a good performance, considering the filthy and regrettable quality of the material written for this film. Bruce Payne sounds histrionic and unconvincing, but he does what he has to do. The rest of the actors don't really have anything really good worth mentioning in detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictim of a very low budget, the film appears for what it is: a very cheap and undercooked production, which tastes bad and looks even worse than it tastes. An excuse for an action movie with swords and frantic duels amid a series of abandoned or deserted industrial sites. The cinematography, sets and costumes are what we would expect to find, but the visual effects and CGI are poor, amateurish and really inexcusable in a 2000s full-length film. It's a disgraceful film.   \n",

Jackson) where he tries to apprehend an arrogant racist killer (Christian Bale) by finding a key witness (Toni Collette) while dealing with a gang lord (Jeffrey Wright) and corrupt cops. Vanessa Williams is on hand as a helpful officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shaft” (2000) is a ‘hip’ crime thriller that resurrects the franchise 27 years after the original trilogy from 1971-1973 that featured Richard Roundtree in the title role (he returns here as the aged uncle). The cast and filmmaking are fine; the problem is the lame story with which they’re shackled. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe key crime in the opening act is glaringly weak. Bale’s character is a snooty punk born with a silver spoon in his mouth, but I didn’t buy his rash, racist actions at the night club. It just didn’t ring true, especially since he seems to get along with black people just fine the rest of the movie. Likewise, Collette’s actions aren’t convincing as the doe-eyed bartender. Simply put, the scriptwriters tried too hard to concoct a racist whitey villain when subtly was in order.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can roll with that serious flaw, there are enough thrills to amuse, including Jackson as the bad axx protagonist and Wright’s entertaining drug lord. Plus it’s always good to see the charming Vanessa Williams. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe film runs 1 hour, 39 minutes, and was shot in various areas of New York City, as well as nearby Newark. \\r\\n\\r\\nGRADE: C-   \n",

But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.\\r\\n\\r\\nPitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... \\r\\n\\r\\nOkies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade \"A\" from those involved. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10</td>\n",

Like many movies, the plot relies on a huge coincidence or three. The story gets sappy and sentimental in places, is rather predictable and has too much religion to suit me, but that last thing may suit you just fine, praise be. It was co-written and directed by the actress Bonnie Hunt, who is a supporting character in the film.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there is a spark of chemistry between the two lead characters, the dialogue is smart and sharp, and the movie is rich with its supporting cast, such as Jim Belushi, Robert Loggia and Archie Bunker - I mean Carroll O’Connor. Plus I have liked Minnie Driver since Circle of Friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust keep in mind this isn’t Hitchcock or Frank Capra stuff and doesn’t try to be. Just let it flow over you   \n",
       "21  All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.\\r\\n\\r\\nPitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. \\r\\n\\r\\nRight from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter-Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... \\r\\n\\r\\nOkies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade \"A\" from those involved. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... \\r\\n\\r\\nThe science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10   \n",
